# Mise En Place

This is a basic template for rails web apps. Frequently used gems are added to Gemfile, rails/spec helper files are created/updated, and similar routine work is done for Ruby/Rails developers.

To get started, clone this repo in your local project directory and run the following lines in your terminal:

```
$ bundle install   # OR bundle update

$ bundle exec figaro install   # to create .application.yml to store private keys
```
